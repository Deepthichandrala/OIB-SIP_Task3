It is about the third task assigned by Oasis Infobyte  internship in the domain of DataScience

Project Title: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning  Purpose: Develop a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various influencing factors.  Here are the steps I performed in this project:  ➡ Data Collection: The data was collected from Kaggle. ➡ Importing Necessary Dependencies: I imported NumPy, pandas, boost and sklearn,matplotlib and seaborn. ➡ Data Processing: I cleaned, transformed, and prepared the data for modeling and also considering a new column known as Age which includes how many years that car was used ➡ Feature Selection: I identified the most important features for price prediction. ➡ Splitting the Data: I split the data into training and test sets. ➡ Model Building: I used logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Regressor, RandomForestRegressor, XGBRegressor. ➡ Error Metric Evaluation: I considered the R-Square value to assess the model fit. The R-Square value for XGBRegressor is 0.945281. This indicates that XGBRegressor is the best-fitted model among all other models.
